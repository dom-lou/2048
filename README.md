# 2048
A small game by [Gabriel Cirulli](https://github.com/gabrielecirulli/2048), recreated by me as a fun exercise.

## Gameplay
"The objective of the game is to slide numbered tiles on a grid to combine them to create a tile with the number 2048; however, one can continue to play the game after reaching the goal, creating tiles with larger numbers." [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2048_(video_game))

- Tiles appear on a 4x4 grid, and can be moved around with the arrow keys
- New tiles appear after each movement, either a 2 or a 4
- Tiles of the same value can be combined together to create a new tiles with double the value
- The goal is to create a tile with the value 2048, in which case you win!
